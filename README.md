# MLA-Helper
MLA-Helper is a master's thesis project intended to enhance and increase transparency for the ML-Agents package in Unity.

## Dependencies
- "com.unity.ml-agents": "2.0.1",
- "com.unity.mathematics": "1.2.6",
- "com.unity.textmeshpro": "3.0.6"

## Showcase
This a complete Unity project where MLA-Helper has been installed and set up for a simple numbers game and all dependencies installed. 
When play mode is enabled and an answer is requested, the game will generate two numbers between 0-10, and the trained model will attempt to decide if the sum is above or not above 10 and below or not below 10.
MLA-Helper will visualize the resulting model, its input, actions, and action marks in the visualization overlay and inspector.
